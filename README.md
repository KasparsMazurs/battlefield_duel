# Battlefield duel  

Battlefield duel is a landing page for a game in which your main task is to win the opponent in a shooting duel. At each turn, you can choose where you want to move and where you want to shoot. An enemy will do the same. Your main goal is to guess where the enemy will move and aim at the place and guess where the enemy will shoot so you can avoid that place. Each time when you or your enemy gets hit his HP will be reduced. First whoever loses all HP will lose.
